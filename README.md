Code respository of a educacional game from a subject of UFRN

It was made in 2020 as a Final Project, it was the first game/project I did and was the first time I coded with JavaScript.

It's a educational game for kids were they need to answer a math question about how much water a city needs based on some information that the game give them and then
control a little character to kickly delivery the water in the right city.
